# Security policy

Security fixes are applied to the current default branch unless a release line is explicitly documented as supported.

Please do not open a public issue containing exploit instructions, credentials, private data, or details that would make an unresolved vulnerability easier to abuse. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available; otherwise contact the repository owner privately through an established GitHub channel.

Include the affected version or commit, impact, prerequisites, and minimal safe reproduction steps. Do not access data that is not yours, degrade services, or test systems without authorization.

For `white-label-model`, application-supplied state and validator inputs may be untrusted. Consumers remain responsible for domain validation at trust boundaries; TypeScript types are not runtime validation.
